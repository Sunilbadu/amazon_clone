# amazon_clone
This project is a static Amazon-style homepage clone built using HTML and CSS. It replicates the look and feel of Amazon’s landing page, including navigation, product categories, and footer sections. The design emphasizes flexbox layout, hover effects, and responsive structure, making it a solid practice project for front-end development.
